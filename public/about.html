<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Amanda, an aspiring web developer with a background in graphic design and a passion for drawing and painting. 
</p>

<p>For the last 9 years, I've been working full-time as a bookkeeper for a small business where I first started out in customer service and dispatch.
  Long ago, I started helping to update and create training materials and provide visual aides for other departments.

<p>My greatest joy is spending time with my family and my two cats, Mason & Marlow, my goofy cuddle buddies who love their lil' soups!</p>
